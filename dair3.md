_In this session, we will review the basics of predictive modeling and approaches to build an accurate and reproducible model, introduce best practices in reporting that will allow others to appropriately interpret and reproduce the results, and discuss guiding principles on how to reproduce othersâ€™ results._

## Accessing Content

I've prepared four Python-based Jupyter Notebooks for this session. There are two ways to access them.

### Option 1: Web-Based Access

<div style="border: 2px solid #2980b9; background-color: #d6eaf8; padding: 16px; border-radius: 6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">
  <strong>Click <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/surajrampure/dair3-2025/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Ffiles%2F01-intro-materials.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a> to open the notebooks in your browser, without the need to install anything.</strong>

 This link uses [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/), a service that allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks in your browser. Some code may not work properly or take a long time to run, but this should suffice for the lesson.

### Option 2: Local Installation

You can also clone our GitHub repository and run the notebooks locally. This option is suggested if you've used Jupyter Notebooks locally before, but if you haven't, the web-based option is probably easier.

Find the repository [**here**](https://github.com/surajrampure/dair3-2025). There is a `requirements.txt` file in the repository that you can use to install the necessary dependencies.

In your Terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surajrampure/dair3-2025.git
cd dair3-2025
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then open the notebooks in your browser by running `jupyter notebook` in your Terminal.
