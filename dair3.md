_In this session, we will review the basics of predictive modeling and approaches to build an accurate and reproducible model, introduce best practices in reporting that will allow others to appropriately interpret and reproduce the results, and discuss guiding principles on how to reproduce othersâ€™ results._

Here, you'll find links to the Jupyter Notebooks for our session. Each link should open a notebook directly in your browser, without the need to install anything.
