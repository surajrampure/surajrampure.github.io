- When writing content for Jupyter Notebook markdown cells, default to normal paragraph Markdown.
- Do not prepend `#` to each generated line.
- Only use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) when the user explicitly asks for headings.
- If editing an existing markdown cell, preserve its current heading structure unless asked to change it.
