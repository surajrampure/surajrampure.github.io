## Finding Datasets

Every so often, students ask where they can find datasets to work on projects on your own. Over the past few years I've compiled this list.

_Last updated January 6, 2022_

### General sources of data

These sites allow you to search for datasets (in CSV format) from a variety of different domains. Some may require you to sign up for an account; these are generally reputable sources.

- Any Google Forms survey you’ve administered! (Go to the results spreadsheet, then go to “File > Download > Comma-separated values”.)

Tip: if a site only allows you to download a file as an Excel file, not a CSV file, you can download it, open it in a spreadsheet viewer (Excel, Numbers, Google Sheets), and export it to a CSV.
