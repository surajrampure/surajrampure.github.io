Spending a day in New York City? Here are my recommendations on where to eat and what to see.

Note that my recommendations are probably more touristy than a local would give, and less touristy than would be found in a generic "what to do in New York" guide you'd find online. I lived in New York for ~10 weeks in Summer 2018, and have visited a few times a year since then; these recommendations are biased towards the meals and sights I've enjoyed more recently. If you've never actually been to New York, make sure to also look at some of those more generic guides (in general, I like the built-in guides that Apple Maps has) to make sure you don't miss any of the "default" sights.
