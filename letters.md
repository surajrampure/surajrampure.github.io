## Recommendation Letter Instructions

If you're reading this page, it's likely because you've asked (or are thinking of asking) me to write you a recommendation letter. Helping students get into graduate programs is one of the great joys of teaching, and if I could help everyone who asks, I would!

But, I receive so many requests that I unfortunately don't have the capacity to write letters for everyone who asks. And even if I did, if my only relationship to a student is that they were enrolled in one of my classes, it's hard for me to say anything convincing in a letter.

As a result, 80%+ of the letters I write each year are for students who served on my course staff at some point (GSI/IA/TA/tutor), as those are the students I interact with the most and have the most first-hand knowledge of. The few other students I end up writing letters for are students who did extremely well in class and/or went above and beyond in some way. That being said, if you don't fall into one of these categories, **don't pre-reject yourself** - still ask me first!

- Your preferred name and pronouns.
- A description of how I know you.
    - What school? (Michigan? UCSD? Berkeley?)
    - What classes you took with me and what grades you got. Include your grade on the Final Exam and what the class average was (Gradescope has this).
    - What classes you GSI/IA/TA/tutored for me and when, and what your responsibilities were (and anything you think you did a particularly good job at).
    - Any standout facts about you that you think I should remember (e.g. created all the discussion worksheets, or had a really excellent final project in the TA training course, or had the most answers of any staff member on Ed, etc.).
- Your latest resume/CV.
- A copy of your (unofficial) transcript.
- A spreadsheet with the following columns, with one row for each program you're applying to:
    - University name.
    - Program name.
    - Application deadline, **in the format MM/DD/YYYY**.
- A brief description of what you're trying to get out of a graduate program.
    - For a letter to be strong, I need to be able to describe what value you'll get out of the program and what value you'll provide to the program, and why you've chosen those programs specifically.
    - This could be a summary or draft of your statement of purpose/similar application responses.

Some other instructions:

- I only need these materials ~two weeks before your earliest deadline. Make sure to tell me clearly when your earliest deadline is!
- Please send me **all** letter requests for all of the programs you're applying to **at the same time**. When I write your letter, it's easiest to sit down and upload it to all of your schools at once; this minimizes the chances that letters sent later slip through the cracks.

The information you should use for me is below.
