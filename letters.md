## Recommendation Letter Instructions

by [Suraj Rampure](../) // _last updated December 14, 2025_

> If you're reading this page, it's likely because you've asked (or are thinking of asking) me to write you a recommendation letter. Helping students get into graduate programs is one of the great joys of teaching.
> 
> The strongest letters I write are for students who served on my course staff at some point (GSI/IA/TA/tutor), as those are the students I interact with the most and have the most first-hand knowledge of. I also often write strong letters for students who did extremely well in class and/or went above and beyond in some way.
> 
> But, many students who don't fall into these categories still ask me to write them a letter. I used to say no to many of these requests, but now I will say yes to most of them, with the understanding that <b>if we don't have a strong working relationship, my letter will mostly just say that you took my class and earned an [insert grade here]. If you're okay with this type of letter – and you might be, since you may have two other strong letters from others who know you better – then keep reading. 

If I agree to write you a letter, here's what I need from you, **ideally all in a single Google Drive folder shared with <code>rampure@umich.edu</code>**:

- Your preferred name and pronouns.
- A description of how I know you.
    - What school? (Michigan? UCSD? Berkeley?)
    - What classes you took with me and what grades you got. Include your grade on the Final Exam and what the class average was (Gradescope has this).
    - What classes you GSI/IA/TA/tutored for me and when, and what your responsibilities were (and anything you think you did a particularly good job at).
    - Any standout facts about you that you think I should remember (e.g. created all the discussion worksheets, or had a really excellent final project in the TA training course, or had the most answers of any staff member on Ed, etc.).
- Your latest resume/CV.
- A copy of your (unofficial) transcript.
- A spreadsheet with the following columns, with one row for each program you're applying to:
    - University name.
    - Program name.
    - Application deadline, **in the format MM/DD/YYYY**.
- A brief description of what you're trying to get out of a graduate program.
    - For a letter to be strong, I need to be able to describe what value you'll get out of the program and what value you'll provide to the program, and why you've chosen those programs specifically.
    - This could be a summary or draft of your statement of purpose/similar application responses.

Some other instructions:

- I only need these materials ~two weeks before your earliest deadline. Make sure to tell me clearly when your earliest deadline is!
- Please send me **all** letter requests for all of the programs you're applying to **at the same time**. When I write your letter, it's easiest to sit down and upload it to all of your schools at once; this minimizes the chances that letters sent later slip through the cracks.
- Make sure to **waive your right to view recommendation letters submitted for you**. This will allow me (and your other writers) to speak more honestly.
